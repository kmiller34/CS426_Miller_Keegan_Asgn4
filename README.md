Unusual Procedure/Rule: Two cat players, in a small room who progress to the next room by completing the puzzle that relates to computer hardware (You must shoot both computer hardware objects to advance).


How we followed the game theme: To follow the game theme we made the playable characters both cats and each objective in a room is meant to be shot so that you can succesffully build a computer. After each step there is a fact you learn which will assist players in preparing for the serious question fulfilling what is needed to complete the serious objective as well. To stay with the hardware theme that goes with shooting each computer hardware component.

Serious Objective: Learn more about computer hardware through the small challenges in each room.

Serious Question: What are the main differences between a SSD and a HDD in terms of performance and functionality, and in what scenarios would you recommend using one over the other?

Answer: SSDs offer faster data access times and improved durability due to their lack of moving parts. Which makes them ideal for tasks requiring high-speed performance, while HDDs are more cost-effective for larger storage capacities in scenarios where speed is not a critical factor.
