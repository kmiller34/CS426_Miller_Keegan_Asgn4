For the two physics constructs I implemented two platforms that utilize a rigidbody in order to have the player able to run into them and jump on top of them without falling through.

For the 2 lights, I added a blue light in the hallway in order to give a more eerie feel that wasn't present before. The second light was a spotlight I added to show off the winning text the user sees when theyve won the game.

The billboard was a moving football player that I added to feel like an NPC.

Just a heads up, I'm very inexperienced with GIT so what I did was I used my Assignment two and ran git remote set-url origin https://github.com/kmiller34/CS426_Miller_Keegan_Asgn4.git
To change the repository and then git add . and git push, but when doing this, I'm not sure why but one of my team members is linked as a collaborator. I tried removing him but github wouldn't let me. I just wanted to point this out so it didn't seem like I was cheating.
